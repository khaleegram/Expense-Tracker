## App Structure:

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant yellow (#FFEA00), symbolizing clarity and a focus on financial tracking. 
- Background color: Light yellow (#FAF9F0), provides a subtle, warm backdrop that is easy on the eyes. 
- Accent color: A vivid orange (#FF8C00), intended to draw the eye to key actions like saving, editing, or important alerts.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font with a neutral and modern appearance, used for both body text and headings.
- Simple, clear icons to represent each wife. For example, stylized initials or representative imagery (e.g., cooking icon, shopping cart, etc.).
- Clean, tabular layout for expense entries. Clearly show the items and wives, with well-spaced rows and columns. Each column will have an obvious header to create an easily readable table. No borders will be used to keep the tables from feeling overwhelming.
- Subtle animations such as row highlights or gentle transitions when new entries are added or edited.
